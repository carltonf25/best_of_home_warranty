        <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">American Home Shield (AHS) is the largest home warranty provider in the United
States, with over 1.5 million customers. AHS is known for the strengths in providing
highly-reliable warranty plans and top-notch contractors. What makes AHS even more
unique is their à la carte plans that allow you to customize your coverage for standard
household systems and appliances.</p> 
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Although the company ranks highly when it comes to plan value and customer
experience, AHS really shines because of the breadth and quality of its contractor 
network, the size and stability of their company, and their contract, which is one of the
least restrictive we've found.</p>
                </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>What we like: </h1>

across the country.</li>
            <li>AHS has one of the least restrictive contracts in regards to coverage. They will
cover repair or replacements of covered items, regardless of age, make or
model.</li>

    <h2>Coverage: </h2>
      <p class="reviewParagraphs">AHS offers three standard plans: a Systems plan, an Appliance plan and their most
popular, a Combo plan that includes everything in the Systems and Appliance plans.
AHS offers their Build Your Own Plan option, so you’re paying for exactly what you
want covered. </p>
    <p class="reviewParagraphs"> If for example your house doesn’t have air conditioning, you can opt out
and receive a lower rate. AHS representatives will work with you to find the most
suitable plan that works best for you.</p>
