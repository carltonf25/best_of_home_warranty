        <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Choice Home Warranty is a leading provider of cost effective home warranty plans and
    offers unparalleled customer service. Choice is highly regarded for their commitment to
    providing fast, efficient and affordable premiums that include basic and total coverage.</p> 
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">They offer a no-fee, transferable warranty plan structure that make their plans ideal for
    homeowners, landlords or realtors who may consider selling their home in the future.
    Choice is however ideal for any existing property owner who’s looking for reliable
    home warranty services that provides security and added value to their home</p>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Another great benefit to using Choice Home Warranty’s plans is their integrated “work
    order dispatch system” that hastens repair and maintenance services. This also ties into
    their easily accessible, personalized home maintenance checklist that reminds the
    homeowner of upcoming or important home considerations. Best of all, all questions
    and concerns can be answered by their customer service call center at anytime, 24/7.</p>
                </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>What we like: </h1>
        <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
          <li>First month is free, regardless of the service contract chosen</li>
            <li>Reliable, knowledgeable and friendly 24/7 call center.</li>
            <li>All warranty plans are 100% transferable to a future homebuyer.</li>
            <li>Respected company in the home warranty industry.</li>
            <li>Automated dispatch service. Think “Uber” for contractors.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>What we dont like: </h1>
          <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
            <li>Terms and conditions exclude certain unforeseeable damages like rust and
    power surges. We advise reading the terms and conditions closely</li>
              <li>Commercial grade or certain high-end products or systems may not be
    completely covered, often limited to a set dollar value.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
    <h2>Basic vs. Total Coverage: </h2>
      <p class="reviewParagraphs">An important element to consider with Choice Home Warranty is their basic and total
coverage options. Although their website outlines some very easy to read coverage
tables, we feel it’s important to outline the real differences.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>Basic Plan: </h1>
        <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
            <li>Heating System</li>
            <li>Electrical System</li>
            <li>Plumbing System</li>
            <li>Plumbing Stoppages</li>
            <li>Water Heater</li>
            <li>Whirlpool Bathtub</li>
            <li>Oven / Range / Stove / Cooktop</li>
            <li>Dishwasher</li>
            <li>Built-in Microwave</li>
            <li>Garbage Disposal</li>
            <li>Ductwork</li>
            <li>Garage Door Opener</li>
            <li>Ceiling and exhaust fans</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1>Total Plan: </h1>
            <h6>Everthing in the basic plan, plus the following: </h6>
                <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
                    <li>Clothes Washer</li>
                    <li>Clothes Dryer</li>
                    <li>Refrigerator</li>
                    <li>Air Conditioning System</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Choice Home Warranty of course offers optional coverage on property items like
pools, vacuum systems, septic systems and more.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h1>Dealing with Contractors: </h1>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Choice Home Warranty makes it very easy for their customers to make a service call
and dispatch a contractor quickly via their automated dispatch technology. When the
contractor arrives, the customer is required to pay $60 to the contract. This fee is more
or less standard in the industry</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Choice Home Warranty is highly focused on their customers and we consider that a
great starting point for any homeowner. In addition to offering comprehensive plans,
affordable premiums, we consider their automated dispatch and around-the-clock
customer service center ensures you have the services you need quickly and easily</p>
