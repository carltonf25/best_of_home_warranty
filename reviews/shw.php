        <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Select Home Warranty is a safe bet for any new homeowner that's looking for basic
coverage on their new home and appliances. Not only do they provide two months of
free coverage upon signing up, they also spell out their terms very clearly.</p> 
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Unlike some
other home warranty providers who opt for confusing limits and terms of service, Select
Home Warranty specifically caters to newer homes and appliances that have not had
previous repairs.</p>
                </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>What we like: </h1>
        <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
          <li>Two months’ coverage upon signing up. Plus they routinely offer other deals on
top of that like $100-200 off or free roof leak protection.</li>
            <li>24/7 reachable customer service line and an online chat system with customer
service agents.</li>
            <li>Clear terms of warranty, no gray areas.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
          <h1>What we dont like: </h1>
          <ul class="reviewParagraphs">
            <li>Warranties are limited to items that have never gone through a repair before.</li>
              <li>Limited coverage for the first three months.</li>
              <li>Specific to new homeowners and appliances, although this can also be a
positive for some people.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
    <h2>Select Home Warrantys Coverage: </h2>
      <p class="reviewParagraphs">Select Home Warranty follows a standard Bronze, Gold and Platinum system. This is
common with a lot of home warranty providers and allows customers to pick a plan that
works specifically for them.</p>
    <p class="reviewParagraphs">Select Home Warranty is very specific about what they cover. This coverage is typically
only tied to the functionality of the appliance or the system. It’s important to read their
terms and conditions carefully to understand your coverage and also the first three
        months of limited coverage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h1>Bronze Plan: </h1>
        <ul class="reviewParagraphs">

        <h1>Customer Service and Contractors: </h1>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Making a claim to Select Home Warranty is easy via their 24/7 phone line or during
business hours on their website, either via email or live chat. Once a claim is processed,
most customers can expect service from a contractor within 2-4 days. Like with most
home warranty contractor services, a non-negotiable $60 fee will need to be paid to
the contractor upon arrival. </p>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs"> Select Home’s network of contractors are all highly trained,
qualified, licensed and offer top notch, quality service. Select Homes will even
reimburse you if they cannot supply you with a contractor of their choosing, depending
on circumstance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Select Home Warranty offers a wide range of plans that fit the needs of many
homeowners or landlords. They clearly list their terms and conditions and are up front
about what they cover. Select Home’s premiums are competitively priced and offer
even more savings with the additional two months of free coverage. </p>
          <p class="reviewParagraphs">Although their
coverage is limited to items that have not went through repair already, this does not
preclude new appliances from being faulty or needing repair. With a Select Home
Warranty plan, you have peace of mind knowing that everything is covered and readily
repairable all within a phone call or the click of a button.</p>
