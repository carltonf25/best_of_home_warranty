<h1 class="aboutus_header">The Idea</h1>
    <h3 class="aboutus_idea">The idea for this site was born after doing some research ourselves.  The topic of home warranties was brought up when one of us explained how he had a $300 dishwasher repair done for a fifth of the cost through his home warranty company; another had a warranty bought for him and had never used it. Skeptical, the others decided to google some top home warranty websites and after awhile, discovered <strong>every single one had a different rating system and a different top ten list.</strong></h3>
    <h3 class="aboutus_idea">Not only did our research lead us to believe that 5 different companies where ranked #1 in the nation, we also came out of the process without any notion of what makes the companies any different from each other.  Do I go with company with a 9.9 rating or the one with a 9.8?  Where did that .1 difference come from? What made one company get 5 stars and another only 4?<strong>&nbsp;Being programmers, we hatched a plan for a real, non biased comparison site.</strong></h3>
    
<h1 class="aboutus_header">The Creation</h1>
    <h3 class="aboutus_idea">The companies on our site were selected based on multiple factors: </h3>
        <ul class="creation_criteria">
            <li>Availability - The companies must be nationwide or at least 90% nationwide.</li>
            <li>Reputable - The companies must be acknowledged by a national watchdog.</li>
            <li>Reviews - The companies must have a decent ratio of good and negative reviews.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="aboutus_idea">In addition to gathering and compiling home warranty information, we also decided to keep up to date, current promotions that are being offered through these respective companies.  This way, if you think a company would be a good fit for you you can also save money at the same time.  Our small team of programmers/home owners truly hope you get benefit out of this platform and that we are able to save you some time on the phone with a salesperson.  If you have any compliments or complaints, feel free to email our developers - bestofhomewarranty@gmail.com</h3>
